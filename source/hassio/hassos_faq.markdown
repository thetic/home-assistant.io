## Is USB Boot for the Raspberry Pi 4 supported?

Due to the complexity of USB and the USB mass storage device class booting from a USB device is brittle. Since booting from a USB drive this process has to be done multiple times (firmware/boot loader and the operating system), there is a high chance that this process doesn't complete in one of these stages. In general, the Linux USB stack is solid. Due to this it is recommended to boot Home Assistant OS from SD card and use a USB attached flash drive as data partition only. The `datactl` command available on the OS shell allows to move the data partition.

That said, booting Home Assistant OS completely from a USB drive (SSD or any other USB mass storage device) works with *some* USB devices. USB Devices which are known to work with Raspberry Pi OS (check the Raspberry Pi Forum) are more likely to work with Home Assistant OS. However, because Home Assistant OS has also U-Boot in the boot chain, there are devices which are known to work with Raspberry Pi OS but do *not* work with Home Assistant OS.

## Is the Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM supported?

The Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM is supported with Home Assistant OS 5.5 and later using the 32-bit and 64-bit image. The 64-bit is the bettere tested option at this point.

## How do I run a specific version of Home Assistant?

For this you would need to install the [Terminal & SSH add-on][ssh] or use the console
that is available on your device by connecting a keyboard and screen.

To install the Terminal & SSH add-on, choose **Supervisor**, which is located in the sidebar and then the add-on store. If you don't see it, enable "Advanced Mode" from your profile page.

Use the web-based terminal or SSH to your Home Assistant system, or connect to the console, and run:

```bash
ha core update --version=0.XX.X
```

Replace 0.XX.X with the version you want. e.g., `0.111.2`

You can also use a similar command for the operating system:

```bash
ha os update --version 4.11
```

## Do I need to leave the USB stick connected for Wi-Fi?

No. The USB "CONFIG" stick is only used to import a network profile to `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` and can be removed.

## 404 Client Error: Not Found ("no such image: homeassistant/...)

This error indicates the image, whether for updating to Home Assistant or installing or updating an add-on, was not able to be pulled to your system. This is usually a situation where there is not enough space for the image to be downloaded. The first thing to check for is the available space on your system.

Please note, if you are running the operating system as a virtual machine; the default VM image is only about 6GB. Many VM users run into this as they have not allocated enough storage. 32GB is the minimum recommended size.

You will need to explore your own system to determine where space has gone.
Using `df -h` in the SSH add-on console to you can quickly check to see if you have space available.

If there is plenty of space available then you might check to see if you are having network issues that are preventing images from being downloaded.

## Why does the start button for an add-on flash red when I click it?

If you are looking for more information about add-ons, which won't start or install, navigate to Supervisor > System in the UI and check the logs.

The logs on this page are the same you would see using `ha logs` in the custom CLI.

## I'm trying to find my files on the host or SD card. Where are they?

On a Home Assistant OS install, your files are on the data partition within `/mnt/data/supervisor/`.
On the SD itself, this is an EXT4 partition labeled `hassos-data`.

On a Supervised install, they are in `/usr/share/hassio/`.
